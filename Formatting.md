# Formatting

Things we **NEED** to format:

------

## In General:

- Maybe learn how to deep destructure so in functional components you won't need to define destructured variables.
- Add coments all throughout the styles.
- Change all fontawesome comentaries to "FONTAWESOME COMPONENT".
- Chack to see if its prudent to leave background colors in **inherit** or not.

## In  `_sidebar.component.jsx`

- Extend it to a class component and, if need be, format it.

## In `_app-components` folder:

- Change the name of the `note` folder to `noteEditor`. Do the same with the files inside it.

## In `_login.component.jsx`

- Rename `<Button />` component.

## In  `_header.component.jsx`

- Change the Notepp name font to Futura.

## In `_mixins.styles.scss`

- Find an alternative to focus on buttons.

## In `_login.styles.sscs`

- Maybe to detach `btn-group` from inside `login-wrap` for better media querie access.
