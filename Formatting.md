# Formatting

Things we **NEED** to format:

------

## In General:

- Maybe learn how to deep destructure so in functional components you won't need to define destructured variables.
- Change all fontawesome comentaries to "FONTAWESOME COMPONENTS".
- Chack to see if its prudent to leave background colors in **inherit** or not.
- Change the **scripts** file name to something more adequate.

## In  `_sidebar.component.jsx`

- Extend it to a class component and, if need be, format it.

## In `_mixins.styles.scss`

- Find an alternative to focus on buttons.
