# Formatting

Things we **NEED** to format:



General:

- Maybe learn how to deep destructure so in functional components you won't need to define destructured variables.
- Finish mentioning where each reducer is used in each component in `rootReducer.js`
- Review and if need be change reducers props names.
- Change `setDisplayedNote` title & body names to something shorter and find a way for them to be desctructured properly.
- See if it would be prudent to delete `notesReference` reducer and get its reference to firestore's `ref` prop in the collection.
- Modulate the actions.js file into folders.

In the `sidebar.component.jsx`

- Extend it to a class component and, if need be, format it.
