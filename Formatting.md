# Formatting

Things we **NEED** to format:



General:

- Maybe learn how to deep destructure so in functional components you won't need to define destructured variables.
- Add coments all throughout the styles.

In the `sidebar.component.jsx`

- Extend it to a class component and, if need be, format it.

In `app-components` folder:

- Change the name of the `note` folder to `noteEditor`. Do the same with the files inside it.
